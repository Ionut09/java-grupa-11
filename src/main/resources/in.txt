Google Code Jam is an international programming competition hosted and
administered by Google.[2] The competition began in 2003[3] as a means to
identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Google[citation needed].
The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a
fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development
environment to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on Topcoder's platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.

Between 2015 and 2018[4], Google also runs Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on
distributed algorithms.[5] This is run in parallel with the regular Code Jam,
with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000,
but is only open for people who qualify to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).

Several Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.[6]
